# H_inverse-with-QP-transformation-of-genetic-groups
This code construct encapsulated unknown parent groups (EUPG) H-inverse of Masuda et al. (2021).
It also construct A-inverese and G-inverse as well as inverse of pedigree based relationship between genotype animals (A22inv). 
Animal Ids should be renumbered.
